    # ACC Proposal
    
    
    ### Process Journal
    
    I think many people including myself are disturbed by the recent increase in political and social divide in the United States. I want to investigate what has caused this divide by focusing on the statistical differences between the two parties that make up a majority of the country; Republicans and Democrats. I'm suspicious of the current administration for reasons that I will make obvious, and the Presidents collaboration with large corporations despite posing as a saviour of the working class.

    ### Inspiration
    
    I knew I wanted to do something in Data Visualization, but I think a lot of times data viz is accompanied by an essay or at least an underlying argument about the world. I cycled through a few ideas; lonliness, climate change, etc. No 1 topic really struck me. We've been doing this Data Art thing for a while now, so a lot of the data thats out there has already been visualized. So I decided that coming up with something new would require me to compare multiple datasets and create a hypothesis. I want to compare several data trends to make a conclusion about the world.
    
    ### Hypothesis
    
    Since the rise of the Technology & Information sectors in the United States, and the proclamation that 'data' is one of the worlds most valuable resources, low density municipalities have fallen to the wayside, and urban areas have become the primary economic, cultural, and educational centers. Specialization and the rise of white collar industries have created an 'ecosystem of expertise' where only those who can afford education are able to qualify for the best jobs. Education at all levels is judged by the institutions ability to filter as many students as possible into the few corporations that control these jobs.

    ### Project Steps (in broad strokes)
    
    1. Collect resources relevant to hypothesis
    2. Write Paper / Make claims based on data.
    3. Prepare Dataviz storyboards based on claims.
    4. Learn techniques based on storyboards (likely using processing).
    5. Test printing.
    6. Design an exhibition that takes the viewer on a journey, presenting words and illustrating with data.
    7. Install on Gov. Island.
