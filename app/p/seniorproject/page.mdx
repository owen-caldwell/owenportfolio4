    ## Project Statement
    *Learning to Paint* is about having fun and creating a new process 
    for a traditional artform. It is personal to me, it is my attempt, 
    my process of learning how to paint in an unconventional way. I am 
    deliberate in ignoring traditional advice despite a nearly 50,000 
    year old history. Brushes, canvas, and pigments are replaced with 
    digital monitors, plotters, and JavaScript. I’ve created an algorithm 
    to generate patterns inspired by the early digital works of 
    [Vera Molnar](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/15/arts/vera-molnar-dead.html), 
    [Eduardo Kac](https://www.ekac.org/kac.minitel.photos.whitechapel.html), and 
    [Hiroshi Kawano](https://www.overheadcompartment.org/the-work-of-art-in-the-age-of-programmatic-abstraction/), 
    to name a few, and their predecessors who created similar systems with 
    pixels and grids like Piet Mondrian and 
    [Gerhard Richter](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gerhard-richter.com/en/art/paintings/abstracts/colour-charts-12/?p%3D1%26sp%3D32&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1743361371470645&usg=AOvVaw1ccWdJlVfrUKH4SQwWPTmz).

    ## Motivation
    I had this idea about a year ago that I would learn to paint, but I am 
    too lazy to buy brushes, oil, and canvas, and I certainly don’t have the 
    dexterity or patience to actually go through with actually learning. 
    But I wanted to learn, so I created my own process and ignored traditional 
    advice. To paint daily and with as little effort as possible, I decided 
    that I would paint a pixel a day, starting at a low pixel count and 
    gradually working my way up to greater and greater detail.

    Although “a pixel a day” was discontinued only two weeks after starting, 
    I hope to breathe new life into the process in anticipation of my senior 
    thesis. I am now at a stage of laziness where I have adapted an 
    [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) to make interesting-looking 
    paintings for me.

    ## Context Review
    My nearest neighbors appear to be NFT artists like 
    [Rafaël Rozendaal](https://www.newrafael.com/). It might be natural to make this 
    project an NFT thing, but I’m not particularly interested in any sort of marketing 
    or monetization of my project, nor am I very fond of the NFT space. I want to regress 
    a little bit and mimic digital artists in early computer technologies.
