## Process

Its tough coming to terms with the fact that this is the first time I've ever worked like this.
There's no other program or class that has ever challenged me to make a project over the course of
months. I feel as though I'm doing a terrible job, but I'm so dejected from school (senioritis) that my typical
perfectionism-reflexes aren't firing. My biggest motivator is the aura of expection from my friends and family,
like this is my *SENIOR PROJECT*, and I imagine that people expect this to be my magnum opus or something. 
At heart I suppose that I'm still the same slacker that used to get D's in middle school. 
In any case, my grappling with how to structure my time and put energy in the right places has clouded my process,
and though I'm finally getting the swing of things by researching fellow artists and making necessary preparations
for my project. 

This hasn't been the smooth, stress-free journey that I wanted for my final semester, but I've learned a lot and
now that I've got my footing I'm prepared to do better.

I would describe my process thusfar as **Good**.


## Project

I'm in a bit of a rut with my project. It's at a place where it could probably *pass* and I'm very happy with my
decision to go on an exploration of L-systems as there's plenty of opportunties for creativity and plenty to write about.


I recieved great criticism from Jerry. He put my project progress in perspective very well for me, saying something like:

> You won't be receptive to criticism at this point, because you've got this thing and it's artwork in a neiche space, and
> people will either know about it and want to know how you made it, or just look at it and maybe think it's cool.

Maybe I should've been insulted, but it struck me as honest and it definitely resonated. I'm certainly open to criticism,
I respect critique as a necessary part of the process of making art, but there aren't many who feel able to 'weigh in' on 
a project thats about this very neiche thing. A lot of the responses I get can be generalized to 'neat!' or 'oh that's 
cool.'

I'll do a second round of asking people for help on this matter. This time around needs a preface, something like "Don't 
worry about what it is, just tell me how it makes you feel." I think I'll get the responses I need out of that. If the 
people whose opinions I respect feel very little, I know I'll need to go deeper.

And of course I need sit down with Luke DuBois, who I didn't know until recently that he studied L-systems in 
graduate school-- *How convenient*!

**Here's what's left to be done.**

 - Acquire an HDMI -> CVBS Converter, either from the Department or on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Converter-ABLEWE-Composite-Supporting-Blue-Ray/dp/B07RX69KR8?sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY)
 - Test the setup without prints: Rasberry Pi running website connected to a CRT TV.
 - Test print. *I'm hesitant to print because the algorithm isn't finished.* 

 I would describe my Project thus far as **Very Good**.
