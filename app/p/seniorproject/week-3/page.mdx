## The First Paintings

Behold! For demonstration purposes I decided to jump ahead a little bit and do larger squares, 
these are varying sizes; 16x16, 32x32... I honestly forget what else.


This first one I did with my girlfriend. If I decide to do titles this one will be called 'Emily's Raindeer.'

These paintings are made in Photoshop. I plan on exporting them as SVGs so a plotter printer can read it (or Riso, 
I'll run tests and decide which is more optimal).

- [Painting 5](/seniorproject/paintings/painting5.png)
- [Painting 6](/seniorproject/paintings/painting6.png)

This is all great and fine, but concerns are looming in my mind.
1. What do I do if I miss a day? My bumbling around the past few weeks has cost me a lot of time. This semester
might get busy, and I'm already up to 5/day.
2. Is this interesting enough? Can I trust that the quantity-over-quality will be the redeeming factor?
3. I agree with professor Brain's concern that these paintings have to go a step further and really *mean something* 
I just have no idea what meaning I could add other than process.
