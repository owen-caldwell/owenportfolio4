## Proposal

_March 12th_ - FDA nutrition labels take time to read and are not
intuitive to understand for most consumers. Many
simply rely on companies to make enticing health
promises through advertising and on packaging. There’s
no doubt nutrition is a complex topic, U.S. educational
institutions do little to equip consumers with the tools
they need to make informed decisions.

> “The U.S. faces an ever-growing epidemic of preventable diet-related
> chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.
> Racial and ethnic minority groups, those with lower socioeconomic
> status, those living in rural areas, and other underserved communities
> disproportionately experience these diet-related chronic diseases.
> Improving nutrition is one of the most effective public health
> interventions for reducing these and other chronic illnesses and
> premature death.” – Food and Drug Administration, 2025.

I suspect that many Americans want to learn more about their food and
know that nutrition labeling is a piece to that puzzle. I want to improve
the legibility of these labels, and provide a knowledge base where
consumers can learn about nutrition, compare products and ingredients,
and get notified about potentially harmful foods.
