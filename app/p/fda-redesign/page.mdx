    # FDA Nutrition Labels

    ## Proposal
    
    *March 12th* - FDA nutrition labels take time to read and are not 
    intuitive to understand for most consumers. Many 
    simply rely on companies to make enticing health 
    promises through advertising and on packaging. There’s 
    no doubt nutrition is a complex topic, U.S. educational 
    institutions do little to equip consumers with the tools 
    they need to make informed decisions.

    > “The U.S. faces an ever-growing epidemic of preventable diet-related 
    chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. 
    Racial and ethnic minority groups, those with lower socioeconomic 
    status, those living in rural areas, and other underserved communities 
    disproportionately experience these diet-related chronic diseases. 
    Improving nutrition is one of the most effective public health 
    interventions for reducing these and other chronic illnesses and 
    premature death.” – Food and Drug Administration, 2025.


    I suspect that many Americans want to learn more about their food and 
    know that nutrition labeling is a piece to that puzzle. I want to improve 
    the legibility of these labels, and provide a knowledge base where 
    consumers can learn about nutrition, compare products and ingredients, 
    and get notified about potentially harmful foods.
