If I were to continue pursuing this topic, I would probably narrow my arguement to the following:

> The rise of expertocracy and the privatization of higher education has put in place a caste-like system
that has expanded wealth inequality and raised the barrier to entry for any field that allocates the 
average American with a liveable wage.

## Going forward

I've done my research and I have a narrow-enough hypothesis. The next step is to identify a data relationship, 
find a reliable source, and come up with an artful way to represent that data.

Here are some rough ideas for data sources:

- Cost of living vs. wages over time. (U.S. Census)


## Backup Ideas

**A Zip Code Map** - Zipcodes in the U.S. are shown on a screen to the left, and on the right,
a video is shown that was taken in that specific zipcode.
