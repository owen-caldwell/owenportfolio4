### Process Journal

I think many people including myself are disturbed by the recent increase in
political and social divide in the United States. I want to investigate what
has caused this divide by focusing on the statistical differences between
the two parties that make up a majority of the country; Republicans and
Democrats.

### Inspiration

I knew I wanted to do something in Data Visualization,
but I think a lot of times data viz is accompanied by an
essay or at least an underlying argument about the world.
I cycled through a few ideas; lonliness, climate change, etc.
No 1 topic really struck me. We've been doing this Data Art
thing for a while now, so a lot of the data thats out there has
already been visualized. So I decided that coming up with something
new would require me to compare multiple datasets and create a hypothesis.
I want to compare several data trends to make a conclusion about the world.

### Hypothesis

Since the rise of the Technology & Information sectors in the United States,
and the proclamation that 'data' is one of the worlds most valuable resources,
low density municipalities have fallen to the wayside, and urban areas have
become the primary economic, cultural, and educational centers. Specialization
and the rise of white collar industries have created an 'ecosystem of
expertise' where only those who can afford education are able to qualify for
the best jobs. Education at all levels is judged by the institutions ability to
filter as many students as possible into the few corporations that control
these jobs.

### Project Steps (in broad strokes)

1. Collect resources relevant to hypothesis. Find strong datasets
   to compare through dataviz. Simultaneously learn how to make a dataviz
   with processing.
2. Write Paper / Make claims based on data.
3. Prepare Dataviz storyboards based on claims.
4. Learn techniques based on storyboards (likely using processing).
5. Test printing.
6. Design an exhibition that takes the viewer on a journey,
   presenting words and illustrating with data. **OR:** abstracting
   the data and create a visual work.
7. Install on Gov. Island.

### Challenges

**Scope is a major concern**. This is a huge topic and I need to do
more research to narrow things down. Maybe instead of a few datasets
I can find one strong relationship to do some writing on.

**Art vs. journalism**. Professor Melody suggested that I shift my
presentation from focusing on the research to abstracting the data.
Make people wonder what this piece is about rather than trying to
illuminate like typical journalism work.

Does this fit the class? I'm essentially doing a research project
and Max MSP has fallen to the wayside. But I'm dying to talk about
this subject because it's been on my mind.
